Please make sure your icons... 

* fit the overall look and feel of elementary OS. It is advised to have a look at the elementary OS [human interface guidelines for icons](https://elementary.io/docs/human-interface-guidelines#iconography) before you start designing. If you are planning to implement status icons you may want to check [Faba](https://github.com/moka-project/faba-icon-theme) or [Numix](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme) beforehand. They make a good base for monochromatic status icons.
* are available in all necessary sizes. For example icons for apps, mimes and places should be available as 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 128 px; status icons in 24 and 48 px.
* are named properly so they automatically replace stock icons. Chrome web apps are generally named `chrome-[randomletters]-Default.svg` and steam games `steam_icon_[number].svg`.
